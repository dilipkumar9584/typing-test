    "These bear, mostly, as on one inclosing point of need. For after the rest is said-after the many time-honor'd and really true things for subordination, experience, rights of property, &c., have been listen'd to and acquiesced in-after the valuable and well-settled statement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn'd over and exhausted-it remains to bring forward and modify everything else with the idea of that Something a man is, (last precious consolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else, divine in his own right, and a woman in hers, sole",
    "the simple idea that the last, best dependence is to be upon humanity itself, and its own inherent, normal, fullgrown qualities, without any superstitious support whatever. This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that deepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate. For it is mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a strong generalization, consolidation. As it is to give the best vitality and freedom to the rights of the States, (every bit as important as the right of nationality, the union,) that we insist on the identity of the Union at all hazards",

    "To improve your typing speed, you need to practice typing frequently. Thatâ€™s the only way to master the finger placement on each key and touch-typing pattern. Typing 10 minutes a day for 6 days will help you speed up your typing more than typing for an hour for only one day. That is because the more often you ask your fingers to remember where the letters are on your keyboard, the easier it will be to remember. After a month or two typing will become almost instinctive and you will be able to type without thinking about where the keys are",
    "THREE little Fairies sat in the fields eating their breakfast; each among the leaves of her favorite flower, Daisy, Primrose, and Violet, were happy as Elves need be. The morning wind gently rocked them to and fro, and the sun shone warmly down upon the dewy grass, where butterflies spread their gay wings, and bees with their deep voices sung among the flowers; while the little birds hopped merrily about to peep at them. On a silvery mushroom was spread the breakfast;"]
